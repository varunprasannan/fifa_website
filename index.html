                Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, born 5 February 1985 is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team.
                Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, both of which are records for a European player. 
                He has won 32 major trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most goals (134) and assists (41) in the history of the UEFA Champions League. 
                He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances and has scored over 770 official senior career goals for club and country. He is also the second male to score 100 international goals and the first European one to achieve the feat.</p>
